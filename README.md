# ADR-graph

# Description
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a significant health risk, and a challenge to accurate cost-benefit considerations for drug treatment. This project uses a graph publicly available drug knowledge to predict possible additional (currently unknown) ADRs for marketed drugs.
